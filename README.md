## KaPKa-Portfolio
KaPKa is a comprehensive portfolio designed to showcase my programming skills. This site offers a deeper insight into my abilities than my GitHub profile, including projects that are not suitable for posting on GitHub. It serves as a stepping stone towards becoming a full-stack developer, enhancing my proficiency in HTML and CSS. The portfolio is built with a responsive design using Bootstrap and follows the ASP.Net MVC model. The backend, written in C#, supports functionalities like the contact form and will be further developed to include more dynamic features.

Please note that this is my previous portfolio. I am currently developing a new one to further demonstrate my growth and skills.
